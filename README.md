# Brain Tumor Detection Web App

####  This repository contains a Flask-based web application for detecting brain tumors using a deep learning model. Users can upload an MRI brain scan image, and the application will predict whether a brain tumor is present or not.

## Deep Learning Model (Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs))


#### The brain tumor detection model used in this application was trained separately and resides in another repository. You can find the model repository [here](https://github.com/Dhruvil5995/Brain_Tumor_Detection).

This is a project for detecting brain tumors using Deep Learning and machine-learning techniques. The project includes a dataset of brain MRI images labeled with tumor or non-tumor classes. It trains a convolutional neural network (CNN) model to classify the images and make predictions. The model is implemented using Python and TensorFlow/Keras.

Brain tumor detection is a critical task in medical imaging, and deep learning techniques have shown promising results in automating this process. This project aims to demonstrate the use of a CNN architecture for classifying brain MRI images as either containing tumors or being tumor-free.
