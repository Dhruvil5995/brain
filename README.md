# Brain Tumor Detection Web App

####  This repository contains a Flask-based web application for detecting brain tumors using a deep learning model. Users can upload an MRI brain scan image, and the application will predict whether a brain tumor is present or not.

## Deep Learning Model (Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs))


#### The brain tumor detection model used in this application was trained separately and resides in another repository. You can find the model repository [here](https://github.com/Dhruvil5995/Brain_Tumor_Detection).



## How to Use

#### Run the app.py file

#### After running 'app.py', click the link (http://127.0.0.1:5000/) to access the brain tumor detection web application.

#### click on this link: http://127.0.0.1:5000/

#### Upload an MRI brain scan image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.

#### Click on the "Predict" button.

#### The application will process the image and display the prediction result: "Detect brain tumor" or "No brain tumor detected."
