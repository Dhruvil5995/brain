# Brain Tumor Detection Web App

####  This repository contains a Flask-based web application for detecting brain tumors using a deep learning model. Users can upload an MRI brain scan image, and the application will predict whether a brain tumor is present or not.

## Deep Learning Model

The brain tumor detection model used in this application was trained separately and resides in another repository. You can find the model repository [here](https://github.com/your-username/brain-tumor-detection-model).

## Usage

## How to Use

#### Upload an MRI brain scan image in JPG, JPEG, or PNG format.

#### Click on the "Predict" button.

#### The application will process the image and display the prediction result: "Detect brain tumor" or "No brain tumor detected."
